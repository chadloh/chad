                  <p>Initial meetings with real estate clients often involve a reality check around price expectations.
                    For example, a buyer comes in expecting they can get much more for their money than is reasonable given the market.
                    Or a seller assumes they can get a price much higher than is typical due to anecdotal evidence that the market is much hotter than it is.
                    Depending on the disconnect's severity, these meetings can be tense and time-consuming as they are less likely to end in a transaction.</p>
                  <p>Predicting the house price with the house features is a common machine learning topic. And the <b>neighborhood</b> is usually an important factor that influences the housing prices.
                    However, neighborhoods are seldom arbitrarily defined. Sometimes there are neighborhoods within a broader neighborhood. Sometimes the neighborhoods are just a few blocks of houses.</p>
                  <p>What if we could estimate the <b>geographic value</b> of the house instead of labeling each house with a few pre-defined neighborhoods? Could this continuous feature improve the price prediction model?</p>
                  <p>This project explores the housing sales data in Ames, IA (provided by Kaggle). Various machine learning models were explored, and the final results were deployed in a preliminary Shiny app.</p>

                    The neighborhood was labeled inconsistently, and the sizes of the neighborhoods (i.e., the number of houses in each neighborhood) varied. Some neighborhoods had less than ten sales data, which could result in overfitting.
                    Instead of using a categorical feature, we engineered a new numerical feature that is related to the geographic value.
                    The geographic value is determined after the model is trained. Here is an example of the geographic value fitted after the ridge regression model.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The geographic value indicates how much value is added to the house for being at that location.
                    The same house with the same features will have a higher price if the geographical value is higher.
                    Using this feature, we can estimate the house price without labeling it in a certain neighborhood.
                    Interestingly, the geographic value correlated with the crime rate – regions with higher crime rates have lower geographic values.

                  <p>
                    Initially, the dataframe included 145 features (including the one-hot encoded and engineered features).
                    This was reduced to 45 through exploratory data analysis, and finally, the features were reduced to 32 using Lasso Regression.
                    The data were then split into the train (70%) and test (30%) datasets.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Multiple Linear Regression</h4>
                  <p>
                    First, the Lasso Regression model was used to eliminate insignificant features.
                    The graph below shows the coefficients of some variables with different lambda values (log-scale).
                    The features that “survive” longer up to a high lambda value have a larger contribution (either positive or negative) to the price.
                    For example, the quality and condition have a large impact on the house price compared to the number of bedrooms and bathrooms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Then, the Ridge regression model was trained. Grid search with cross-validation (3 folds) identified lambda of 0.0032 to be the best for the Ridge model and returned an R-squared of 0.900.
                    The figures below show how the prediction compares to the actual sales price. And the residual map shows which house the pricing model is overestimating (red) and underestimating (blue).
                  </p>
                  <h4>Support Vector Regressor</h4>
                  <p>
                    A support vector regressor model using a radial basis function kernel and epsilon set to 0.1 and gamma set to 0.01 returned an R-squared of 0.918.
                    Grid search and cross-validation with 5 folds returned epsilon of 0.01, gamma unchanged, C of 1, and a score (R-squared) of 0.916.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Random Forest Regression</h4>
                  <p>
                    Random forest regression returned an R-squared of 0.898 with 1,000 trees and 7 max features per tree.
                    Grid search with cross-validation (5 folds) returned 500 trees, 8 max features, and minimum samples per leaf of 1 and 2 per split (R-squared=0.899).
                    The top features in this model were overall quality, exterior quality, 1st-floor square feet, garage cars, and the number of baths.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Gradient Boosting</h4>
                  <p>
                    Gradient boosting with 5,000 trees, a learning rate of 0.01, and 7 max features returned an R-squared of 0.922.
                    While extreme gradient boost with 5,000 trees, a learning rate of 0.01, 7 max features, gamma of 0.01, a subsample of 0.8, and column sample of 0.8 returned an R-squared of 0.923.
                    The top features in this model were overall quality, garage cars, 1st-floor square feet, kitchen quality, and basement quality.
                  </p>
